Funny, how all dog lovers are losing their minds over Delhi dogs being caught while literally eating the bodies of murdered animals and drinking the stolen milk of cows and buffaloes who were raped for it.  hypocrites, every one of you.

## Slide 1

Enraged and furious about the Indian Supreme Court's order to capture and displace community dogs?

Feeling powerless in a country which treats these animals' freedom as a joke?

Here's what you can do.

## Slide 2

Before you post to organise protests to display your outrage, take a minute to consider are dogs really the victims?  Yes?  Good.  Are the animals worthy of their freedom?  Yes?  Is the Supreme Court's decision cruel and bizarre?  Yes?

## Slide 3

So, why do you still use excuses just as absurd, when the other animals are stripped off of their freedom and commodified?

Are the animals raped for their milk not the victims of your sick mentality?

Are the animals slaughtered not deserving of their freedom, while you parade in the excuse of 'this is the way things have been'?

Why are the animals caged for culture, entertainment or fashion not worthy of your moral consideration?

## Slide 4

Do you really understand and respect freedom when you still look at the non-humans as objects to use as you please?  This selective outrage is dripping with hypocrisy.

While the Indian Supreme Court and the legal framework of this country keeps on failing animals, use this opportunity to purge your human-centric attitude towards animals.

Boycott and condemn animal oppression.  Stop being a hypocrite.  Start respecting and upholding animal rights.
