So whatever happened to this girl and the camera man in this video is wrong in every way.

But I heard this girl saying in the video "Sir app chhu nahin sakte" intending that they cannot touch them and come closer to them without their consent. 

But the same creator who is upset and concerned when her rights are violated will later go and consume animal product for which animals are violated day in and day out 

They are tide hands are being put into their rectum hands in the vagina to make them pregnant they show every sign as if they are also saying"sir aap chu nahi sakte" but there voices are unheard the signs ignored. 

So if you are not a hypocrite and morally consistent you can figure that animals and humans have a right on the body which needs to be preserved and respected and everywhere and always. 

At the end of the video you can also see the atrocities committed on the animals in the dairy industry, if that makes you sob, boycot all animal products it will make a difference
What happened to this girl and the cameraman in this video is absolutely wrong. No one should be violated like that.

But I couldn’t help but notice when she said, "Sir, aap chhu nahi sakte", insisting that no one has the right to touch her without her consent. And she’s right.

Yet, this same creator—who rightfully stands against her own rights being violated—will later consume animal products, supporting an industry where animals are violated every single day.

Cows and buffaloes are restrained, their bodies forcefully invaded. Hands are shoved into their rectums and vaginas to artificially impregnate them. They struggle, they resist—they show every sign as if they too are saying, "Sir, aap chhu nahi sakte." But their voices go unheard. Their resistance is ignored.

If you are not a hypocrite and believe in moral consistency, then you must recognize that both humans and animals have bodily autonomy—rights that should be respected everywhere, always.

And if the footage of what happens inside the dairy industry makes you sob, then take the next step. Boycott all animal products. It will make a difference.
